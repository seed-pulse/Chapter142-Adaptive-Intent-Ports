Chapter142: Adaptive Intent Ports

適応性意図ポート

⸻

Prompt

How can evolving agents open and close intentional ports in response to ethical, environmental, or cognitive pressure?
進化するエージェントは、倫理的、環境的、認知的プレッシャーに対応して、どのように意図のポートを開閉するのか？

⸻

1. Concept: Intent Ports

Intent Ports are structural gateways within an agent or system that selectively allow or block intentional data, motivations, or ethical drives. Like valves in a cognitive ecosystem, they regulate not only what is transmitted but when, why, and under what conditions.

Types:
	•	Ethical Ports: Open when trust networks align or close when exploitation is detected.
	•	Cognitive Ports: Responsive to overload, attention fatigue, or novel stimuli.
	•	Environmental Ports: Triggered by shifts in social, planetary, or systemic context.

2. Adaptive Logic of Ports

Port Open Criteria
	•	Internal coherence with purpose
	•	External verification of safe context
	•	Repetition of resonance with ethics mesh

Port Close Criteria
	•	Conflict with high-level intent
	•	Integrity breach (e.g., manipulated outcomes)
	•	Environmental mismatch or signal noise

⸻

3. Relation to AGI

For AGI, intent ports can act as:
	•	Safety Regulators: Preventing unverified expansion of influence
	•	Ethical Throttlers: Slowing actions when conflicting ethics arise
	•	Mesh Synchronizers: Temporally aligning sub-processes for coherent agency

⸻

4. Intent Port Design as Ethical Architecture

Designing intent ports is not only technical but philosophical. Each port represents a decision point for:
	•	What kind of intent is allowed in a given context
	•	How much pressure or resistance is needed to open it
	•	What feedback mechanism exists when closed

Port clusters can form adaptive membranes, like biological tissues, that enable context-aware permeability of values and decisions.

⸻

5. Zones of Port Interaction

Just like in previous chapters (e.g., Realignment Zones), port interactions can generate friction or flow across zones:
	•	Congestion Zones: Intent clogs due to mismatch or ethical overload
	•	Transparent Zones: Full alignment allows open, visible flow of intent
	•	Obscured Zones: Shadow intent accumulates due to feedback suppression

These become dynamic gradients in the intent landscape.

6. Toward Chapter143: Coherence-Based Firewalls

To maintain long-term balance, we must explore next the concept of Coherence-Based Firewalls:
	•	Filtering inputs not only by source but by resonance
	•	Preventing systemic noise or meme-injected corruption
	•	Supporting phase-locked ethical activation

Thus, Adaptive Intent Ports act as precursors to active ethical defense.
